# GFS Protocol: Comprehensive Data Flow and Processing Specification
Version 1.0.0

## 1. Overview
The GFS Protocol is a comprehensive system designed to process ISO20022 financial messages across blockchain networks. The protocol is composed of several interconnected components, each responsible for specific functionalities within the message processing lifecycle.

## 2. System Architecture
The GFS Protocol follows a layered architecture, with each layer handling distinct responsibilities while maintaining strict boundaries of concern. The primary layers are:

### 2.1 Registry Layer
The registry layer serves as the protocol's system of record, maintaining authoritative data about messages, targets, and processing status. This layer consists of:
- **MessageRegistry**: The central source of truth for all messages in the system. It generates unique message IDs, creates and stores message records, and manages the transitions of message status.
- **TargetRegistry**: Maintains the directory of valid message destinations, including their addresses, chain IDs, and target types. It verifies the existence and status of targets during message routing.

### 2.2 Protocol Layer
This layer enforces protocol standards and manages system governance:
- **MessageProtocol**: Enforces ISO20022 message standards, managing message format versions, validating message structure, and maintaining a schema registry.
- **ProtocolGovernance**: Handles system upgrades, parameter management, voting processes, and emergency actions.

### 2.3 Processing Layer
The processing layer executes the core message handling logic:
- **MessageRouter**: Manages message delivery paths, handles cross-chain communication via the Wormhole protocol, tracks delivery status, calculates routing fees, and manages gas limits per chain.
- **MessageProcessor**: Coordinates business logic execution, manages the handler registry, routes messages to appropriate handlers, tracks processing results, and maintains handler permissions.
- **MessageHandler**: Implements the business logic for specific message types, determines settlement requirements, and returns processing results.

### 2.4 Settlement Layer
Handles the financial settlement aspects:
- **SettlementController**: Receives settlement instructions from message handlers and the Wormhole protocol, processes settlement requests, interacts with liquidity pools, tracks settlement status, and manages trusted chain relationships.
- **LiquidityPool**: Provides the necessary liquidity for settlements, executes token transfers, manages token balances, and handles settlement execution.

## 3. Message Processing Flow
The GFS Protocol follows a structured flow for processing ISO20022 messages, which can be broken down into the following phases:

### 3.1 Message Entry and Validation
1. **Initial Contact (ProtocolCoordinator)**: The ProtocolCoordinator receives the message submission, validates the submission parameters, calculates the required fees, and checks the message size limits.
2. **Message Registration (MessageRegistry)**: The ProtocolCoordinator generates a unique message ID and registers the message in the MessageRegistry, creating the initial record and setting the status to "PENDING".
3. **Format Validation (MessageProtocol)**: The MessageRegistry forwards the message to the MessageProtocol, which validates the message format against the registered ISO20022 schemas, checks for required fields, and verifies the message type support and format version.

### 3.2 Routing and Delivery
1. **Route Analysis (MessageRouter)**: The ProtocolCoordinator delegates the routing and delivery decision to the MessageRouter, which determines the target chain location, calculates the delivery fees, selects the optimal delivery path (local or cross-chain), and prepares the routing packet.
2. **Processing Paths**:
   - **Local Processing**: The MessageRouter interacts with the MessageProcessor to resolve the appropriate message handler, execute the handler logic, and process the handler result.
   - **Cross-Chain Processing**: The MessageRouter prepares the VAA (Verified Action Approval) and transmits the message via the Wormhole protocol, tracking the delivery status and updating the MessageRegistry accordingly.

### 3.3 Handler Processing
1. **Local Handler Execution (MessageProcessor)**: The MessageProcessor invokes the appropriate message handler, which executes the business logic and determines if settlement is required.
2. **Settlement Initiation (if required)**: If the message handling requires settlement, the handler directly engages the SettlementController to initiate the settlement process.

### 3.4 Settlement Processing
1. **Settlement Sources**:
   - **Local Handler Settlement**: The handler sends the settlement parameters to the SettlementController, which processes the settlement request, executes the transaction via the LiquidityPool, and updates the settlement status.
   - **Cross-Chain Settlement**: The Wormhole protocol forwards the settlement instruction to the SettlementController, which verifies the source chain, processes the settlement, and executes the transaction through the LiquidityPool.
2. **Settlement Execution (SettlementController â†’ LiquidityPool)**: The SettlementController verifies the available liquidity, executes the token transfer, updates the balances, and returns the settlement result.
